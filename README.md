This is a prototype of sampler aplication which contains some samples from good old hip-hop songs. 
You can add sound from library to a pattern and play like on MPC or something. Also you can charge playback rate of samples
in BPM (beats per minute) to synchronize it with playback (CDj or vinyl/serato). It's not finished project obviously. 
I made it using ReactJS SASS and SoundManager library.Cheers
